    <blockquote>     
     <p markdown="1">
     When sun rises above the horizon to a length of 1 or 2 spears (1 spear is about 3m) and it takes roughly about 15-20 minutes. Time between `sunrise` and `ishraq` is `makruh` time and no prayer should be offered. Only exception is, if the funeral procession arrived for its prayer at such a time it will not be disliked at all.

    <blockquote>
     <p markdown="1">
      `Makruh` time is between `zawal` and `zuhr` and one should avoid offering any prayer or prostration of recital for a verse. Only exception is, if the funeral procession arrived for its prayer at such a time it will not be disliked at all.

    <blockquote>
     <p markdown="1">
      This is the dimming of the sun during the last portion of the day before sunset, such that one can look at it without any harm to the eye. One can only offer `'Asr` of that day, which remains valid even during this time and hence obligatory to pray, despite the sin entailed in delaying to this time. Only exception is, if the funeral procession arrived for its prayer at such a time it will not be disliked at all. This time is roughly 15-20 mins before sunset but it also depends on certain factors like latitude and time of the year.
